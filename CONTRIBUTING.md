# Contributing to SpanDex

Thanks for thinking about contributing! :+1:

If you have encountered a bug (or just have a question on how to use the library), feel free to open an issue immediately. If reporting a bug, please include the version of SpanDex you are using, your runtime platform and version, and code to reproduce the problem.

If you have an idea for code, or would like to contribute some code, open an issue for discussion.. If it works well with the library then create a PR and I'll review it.

That's it! Thanks for considering contributing! :+1:
